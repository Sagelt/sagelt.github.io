# The Myth of Civilization

Write a bit about a historical telling of actual gameplay here.

That isn't how it happened. That's easy enough to see. We look at a playthrough of _Civilization_ (_Civ VI,_ in this case) and the contrasts to recorded history are an entry point in to understanding the gameplay and the veneer which transforms a retelling of gameplay choices in to a historical narrative.

But aside from the obvious changes from recorded history, _Civilization_ more subtely describes a world that is not ours. Its systems portray a world that works differently than ours.

These changes are for the most part to create a better gameplay experience. And in that they succeed—_Civilization_ is a brilliant series. But we also need to be aware of the assumptions the series makes, because if we let those assumptions become our own we risk applying them to the world around us. For the actual world we see, for the history we've inherited, these ideas can make us blind to important contributions, important events, and the way the world actually works. If we let these assumptions guide our way forward 

To be utterly clear, I love _Civilization_ as a series, and _Civ VI_ in particular. This critical reading of the games' systems is from that deep appreciation of the impressive design of these wonderful games. It is born of playing _Civ VI_ and deeply enjoying it but noticing as I unpacked this latest iteration that it was subtly disturbing in how it says the world works. Loving a creative endeavor means investing in it and thinking it through.

For clarity I'll be using _Civilization VI_ as my point of reference for how each of these systems work. Many of them can be traced through other _Civ_ games as well.

## The Myth of Great Men & The Myth of Heroic Invention

## The Myth of Progress

## The Myth of Essentialism

## The Myth of Enlightenment

Religion in _Civ VI_ is never part of a tradition so much as it is a _sui generis_ creation. There is no slow drift of one tradition from another (at times catalyzed by notable stories of a specific person), instead each religion is born in a specific year entirely of its own. Each religion is built from a distinct set of early beliefs, not as an offshoot of another religion.

If your game of _Civ VI_ includes Judaism, Christianity, and Islam they will be completely distinct inventions owing nothing to each other.

Unless your selection of players (flesh or AI) is particularly faith-averse, all the major religions of the world will have also been founded very early. By 622 CE when Muhammad went to Medina your religions will likely have been around for many years. By 1517 CE when Martin Luther nails up his _Ninety-five Theses_ your world may be well on the way to a religious victory (where at least half of the cities in every empire of the winning religion).

This sense of religions as competing inventions owing nothing to each, when carried over to the world around us, erases the lines of heritage and understanding the run through faith communities. There can be no cooperation between people of different faiths when they are competing meters attempting to fill up and lay claim to a city or empire.

Ultimately in _Civ VI_ religion is a product of a civilization, not vice versa. All of the Abrahamic religions can be argued (as in _[Fields of Blood](http://amzn.to/2j63yy9)_) to be reactions to systematic violence of the cultures they grew from as can many other religions, but in _Civ VI_ a religion is an extension of the empire in which it starts.

There's a certain accuracy here—treating religion as a central part of culture not as a distinct pursuit lines up with how religion has been viewed through much of human history. The modern distinction of religion from art, culture, and politics is a recent invention. But _Civ VI's_ binding of empire and religion does a disservice to religion as a vector of protest against governance. A religion in _Civ VI_ is a mask an empire wears to pursue its spread and never anything more.

While religion as an arm of empire is certainly a common historical theme, to make it inescapable is to reduce the private choice of faith in to an act of conquest. If this was the way we viewed the world around us then every "outside" religion is an infiltrator bringing victory to some other entity.

## The Myth of Victory

This may be both the most essential and the most pernicious myth of _Civ VI_ and the entire series: that among the people of the world across the long arc of history there is a winner and that winner is a nation-state.

## The World As It Is

_Civilization's_ design is for gameplay first and foremost, and it succeeds admirably in that. It's not surprising that making a game of the long historical arc of humanity requires some choices that paint the world differently than it exists around us. More surprising, though, is that people all around us _do_ see the world this way.

Games are excellent engines for exploring the experiences of others, since the core conceit of a game is to make choices based on systems that are not normally in effect on your life. When those systems reflect the pressures on the Afghani government (as in _[A Distant Plain](http://amzn.to/2j62Hxq)_) you may gain a new understanding of the conflicts there. _Civilization VI_ ostensibly puts you in the position of making choices from a position of a ruler, but what it gave me empathy for was a certain set of conservative values. When a civilization is valued over all—when it can win victory through being the greatest (again)—and it competes through culture and religion, the world becomes a dimmer place. There is no collective improvement, only a zero-sum game of winners and losers. _Civilization VI_ is a chance to see the world through the eyes of a nationalist and the view is of being perpetually under assault and at risk of losing.
