# latorra.org - hosted on GitHub
This is a port of my older Wordpress site to GitHub. Static HTML off of GitHub is pretty much my favorite hosting ever, you should really try it.

## Theme
The theme used (and the base respository that I forked) is Trophy by Thomas Vaeth.

Trophy is a blog theme for Jekyll built using HTML, Sass, and JavaScript (no jQuery). External stylesheets and libraries included are Google Fonts, Font Awesome, Normalize.CSS, and WOW.js.
